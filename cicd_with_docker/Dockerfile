# Use an official Apache base image
FROM httpd:2.4

# Copy custom configuration files or content if needed
# Uncomment and customize the following lines as necessary:
# COPY ./my-httpd.conf /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf
# COPY ./public-html/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/

# Expose port 80 for the web server
EXPOSE 80

# No CMD required as httpd:2.4's base image already runs Apache
